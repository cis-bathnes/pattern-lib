### Downloading the repo

Download the repo from <https://github.com/cis-bathnes/pattern-lib>

If you clone a project with the toolkit submodules installed you will need to initialise the submodules with the following command:

`$ git submodule init`

This pulls down the files from the submodules.

To update the toolkit to the latest version's of the toolkit repository's submodules you can use:

`$ git submodule update`

Or, if you're using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), you can double click on the submenus to update them and make sure the files have been pulled down.
