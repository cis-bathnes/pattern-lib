notes: |
    - all form fields should be given labels
    - donâ€™t hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary
    - labels should be aligned above their fields
    - label text should be short, direct and in sentence case
    - avoid colons at the end of labels
    - labels should be associated with form fields using the for attribute

<label class="form-label" for="full-name-f1">Full name</label>
<input class="form-control" id="full-name-f1" type="text" name="full-name-f1">
